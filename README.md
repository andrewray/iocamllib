# IOCamllib

A set of utilities for [IOCaml](https://github.com/andrewray/iocaml).

Although it builds into a library, and may be used as such, this is
mainly intended to be a repository of useful stuff for the iocaml notebook
from which you can pick and choose bits.  Check the `_tags` file for
dependancies.

At the moment it mainly defines some `#install_printer` routines.
